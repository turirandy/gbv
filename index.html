            <h4>Sexual Violence</h4>
            <p> Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting.</p>
            <p>It is also any act, attempted or threatened, that is sexual in nature and carried out without the consent of the victim.

It can happen within marriages, especially when there is a lack of consent for sexual activity by one of the spouses.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Domestic and Family Violence</h4>
            <p> Family and domestic violence are abusive behaviors in which one individual gains power over another individual. Intimate partner violence typically includes sexual or physical violence, psychological aggression, and stalking. This may include former or current intimate partners.</p>
            <p>It also defines to any physical, sexual, psychological, verbal and economic violence between one person and another within the family. It may be committed by family members and/or people considered as family members, whether or not they live in the same household.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Socio-economic Violence</h4>
            <p>Socio-economic violence refers to actions or behaviors that cause economic harm or disadvantage to an individual, often stemming from unequal power dynamics or systemic inequalities. It can manifest as financial abuse, denial of resources, or limitations on opportunities for education and employment, and is frequently linked to gender-based violence and harmful social norms. </p>
            <p>It also excludes a person from participating in society. This includes the denial of access of the person to health services, education and work, and the denial of his or her civil, social, economic, cultural and political rights.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Harmful Practices</h4>
            <p>Harmful cultural practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) are discriminatory practices committed regularly over such long periods of time that societies begin to consider them acceptable.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Physical Violence</h4>
            <p>Physical violence is the intentional use of force against another person, resulting in or intending to cause physical pain, injury, or harm. It can range from minor acts like pushing to severe acts like assault or even death. Physical violence is a form of aggression and a demonstration of power imbalance. </p>
             <p>Physical violence such as beating, punching, maiming and killing (with or without weapons) is often combined with non-violent forms of SGBV, including emotional and psychological violence.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Emotional or psychological violence</h4>
             <p>Emotional or psychological violence is non-sexual, verbal abuse that is insulting and degrading to the victim. This can include isolating a person from his or her friends and family.</p>
            <p>Psychological abuse is behaviour that aims to cause emotional or mental harm. It may not hurt your body, but can be just as painful and distressing in other ways. No one behaves perfectly in their relationships all the time. However, when someone deliberately hurts you over and over again it becomes abusive.</p>
